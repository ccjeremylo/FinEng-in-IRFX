# Financial Engineering in IRFX in C++

![Repo Status](https://github.com/ccjeremylo/FinEng-in-IRFX/actions/workflows/cpp-ubuntu.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

Following structure of [this course](https://www.city.ac.uk/prospective-students/courses/short-courses/financial-engineering-in-interest-rates-and-fx-cplusplus-applications-in-quantitative-finance). <br />

Topics Include:

- Binomial tree/pricer
- American & path-dependent options
- Monte Carlo methods
- Non linear solvers for implied vol
- Curve construction
- Short rate modelling
- HJM
- LMM
- SABR
- etc... <br />
  
Contributions are *more* than welcome! <br />

The current format/set-up is largely based on [this repo](https://github.com/KYLChiu/ExoticMonteCarloEngine/tree/master). Special thanks to [Kelvin](https://github.com/KYLChiu) for letting me copy his set up.

## Features

- Python binding of c++ code via [```pybind11```](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) (see this [readme file](https://github.com/ccjeremylo/FinEng-in-IRFX/blob/main/src/pybind_example/README.md) for more info)
- Unit test suite supported by [```googletest```](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- CI via [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- Code review of jupyter notebooks via [ReviewNB App](https://github.com/apps/review-notebook-app)
- Auto formatting via ```clang-format```

## Requirements

- CMake
- C++11 compliant compiler
- Python3.7 or above
- Gtest

## Install, Build & Run

*All commands* below are assumed to be run from root of the repo, unless specified otherwise.

### Build

```
cmake -S ./ -B build
cmake --build build
./build/exec
```

### Run tests

```
ctest --test-dir ./build --output-on-failure
```

### Build and run tests

The following script only works for linux/macOS users:

```
./build_and_test_proj.sh
```

### Set up & using ```pybind11```

See this separate [readme file](https://github.com/ccjeremylo/FinEng-in-IRFX/blob/main/src/pybind_example/README.md) for details <br />

The following scripts only work for linux/macOS users (and assumes dependencies have been installed) - best to refer to this [readme file](https://github.com/ccjeremylo/FinEng-in-IRFX/blob/main/src/pybind_example/README.md) for set up. <br />

Install our c++ python binding ```fineng_irfx``` into the virtual env ```.venv```:

```
./deploy_cpp_module.sh
```

Now, you can also launch a jupyter lab session with the required virtual env:

```
./launch_jupyter.sh
```
