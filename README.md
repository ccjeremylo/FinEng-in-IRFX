# Financial Engineering in IRFX in C++

![Repo Status](https://github.com/ccjeremylo/FinEng-in-IRFX/actions/workflows/cpp-ubuntu.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

Following structure of [this course](https://www.city.ac.uk/prospective-students/courses/short-courses/financial-engineering-in-interest-rates-and-fx-cplusplus-applications-in-quantitative-finance). <br />

Topics Include:
  - Binomial tree/pricer 
  - American options
  - Monte Carlo methods
  - Non linear solvers for implied vol
  - Curve construction
  - Short rate modelling
  - HJM
  - LMM 
  - SABR
  - etc... <br />
  
Contributions are *more* than welcome! <br />

The current format/set-up is largely based on [this repo](https://github.com/KYLChiu/ExoticMonteCarloEngine/tree/master). Special thanks to [Kelvin](https://github.com/KYLChiu) for letting me copy his set up.

## Features
* Python binding of c++ code via [```pybind11```](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) (see this [readme file](https://github.com/ccjeremylo/FinEng-in-IRFX/blob/main/src/pybind_example/README.md) for more info)
* Unit test suite supported by [```googletest```](https://github.com/google/googletest)
* CI via [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
* Code review of jupyter notebooks via [ReviewNB App](https://github.com/apps/review-notebook-app)
* Auto formatting (tbd)

## Requirements
* CMake 
* C++11 compliant compiler
* Python3.7 or above
* Gtest

## Install, Build & Run

*All commands* below are assumed to be run from root of the repo, unless specified otherwise.

### Build:
```
cmake -S ./ -B build
cmake --build build
./build/exec
```
### Run tests:
```
ctest --test-dir ./build
```
### Build and run tests:
The following script only works for linux/macOS users:
```
./build_and_test_proj.sh
```

### Set up & using ```pybind11```:
See this separate [readme file](https://github.com/ccjeremylo/FinEng-in-IRFX/blob/main/src/pybind_example/README.md) for details <br />

The following scripts only work for linux/macOS users (and assumes dependencies have been installed) - best to refer to this [readme file](https://github.com/ccjeremylo/FinEng-in-IRFX/blob/main/src/pybind_example/README.md) for set up. <br />

Install our c++ python binding ```fineng_irfx``` into the virtual env ```.venv```:
```
./deploy_cpp_module.sh
```
Now, you can also launch a jupyter lab session with the required virtual env:
```
./launch_jupyter.sh
```

* The Python code can be found [here](https://github.com/ccjeremylo/FinEng-in-IRFX/tree/main/src/python)
* Example tests can be found [here](https://github.com/ccjeremylo/FinEng-in-IRFX/tree/main/tests)
* Project to-do list are [here](https://github.com/ccjeremylo/FinEng-in-IRFX/issues)


### Lecture 1
* Binomial tree option pricing
  - using [function pointers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_pointer) to switch payoffs
  - different choices of tree structure
  - analysing prob distribution generated by binomial tree
  - computing Binomial coeff using recurrsion

### Lecture 2
* Binomial tree option pricing continued:
  - improve code design by using [OO design patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)
  - pricing path-dependent (knock-out) options
  - CRR model, numerical/analytical implementation
  - connection to Black Scholes
  - risks computation via finite differencing

### Lecture 3
* Binomial tree option pricing continued:
  - pricing early excerise payoffs (American/Bermudans)
  - introduction of [C++ templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_(C%2B%2B))
  - multiple inheritance in C++
  - numerical stability and convergence speed

* [Monte Carlo methods](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/gilesm/mc/):
  - pricing vanilla options
  - using [Box-muller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Muller_transform) as RNG
  - discretisation via [Eulerâ€“Maruyama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Maruyama_method)
  - pricing path-dependent payoffs (barrier/Asian)
  - discretisation error in long stepping (terminal correlation)
 
### Lecture 4
* Monte Carlo methods continued:
  - Monte Carlo error analysis and convergence
  - [variance reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_reduction) techniques
  - pricing arithmetic asian with geometric asian as [control variate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_variates)
  - pricing barrier with vanilla option as control variate
  - error analysis continued
  - pricing early excerise payoffs (American/Bermudans)
  - [risks computation & error analysis](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/gilesm/mc/module_2/module_2_2.pdf)
